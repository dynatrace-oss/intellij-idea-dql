Ensures all used variables are defined only once.

<p>
    This inspection will report an error if it discovers a macro definition for a variable that was already defined.
</p>

<pre><code>
'// We are defining the $variable'
$variable = INT:i;
'// This is an error: we are using $variable2, which was not defined'
LONG:l $variable2
</code></pre>

After applying the quick fix, the duplicated definition will be dropped.
