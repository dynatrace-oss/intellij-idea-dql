Checks if both sides of a comparison operation are valid.
<p>
    This inspection focuses on the validity of types returned by expressions used in the operation.
    The information shown to the user will compare all possible types for the left, and the right side, with values
    returned by the expression.
    To be a deemed valid expression, both sides must be supported data types.
    See all supported operation types

        in the official Dynatrace documentation.
