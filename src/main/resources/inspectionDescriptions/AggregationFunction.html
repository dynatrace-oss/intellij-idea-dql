Ensures an aggregation function is used in the aggregating context.
<p>
    Some DQL commands require a specific set of functions, called "aggregation functions".
    This inspections checks if the field on the list uses one of that functions.
</p>
<pre><code>
timeseries {
  somefield = avg(metric), // avg is one of the aggregation functions
  min(metric), // min is one as well
  matchesValue(metric, "test") // because the matchesValue is not an aggregation function, it will be reported as an error
}
</code></pre>
