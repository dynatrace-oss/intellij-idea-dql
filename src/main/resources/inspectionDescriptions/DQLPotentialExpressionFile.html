Detects when a DQL file contains expressions that don't parse as valid DQL queries.

<p>
    This inspection identifies files where the content fails to parse as a valid DQL query,
    but would be valid as a DQL expression. Such cases can be properly parsed as a separate language, which this
    plugin does support for files with the <code>.dqlexpr</code> extension.
</p>

<p>
    The inspection validates that the file content would parse correctly as a DQL expression before suggesting
    the conversion. This ensures that converting the file will resolve the parsing errors.
</p>
<pre><code>
not matchesValue(field, "something") and matchesPhrase(field2, "somethingelse")
</code></pre>

<p>
    The inspection will suggest converting the file to use the <code>.dqlexpr</code> extension
    to properly support expression-only syntax.
