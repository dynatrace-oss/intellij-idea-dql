Makes sure the variable value is defined.
<p>
    Although DQL variables are supported in Dynatrace Dashboards, where the user can provide definitions for them,
    the default Dynatrace DQL execution environment does not allow defining variables, causing the
    <code>$ isn't allowed here</code> error.
    Because the plugin uses such non-variable environment, all variables would be reported as errors, especially when
    using the live validations mode with the connection to a Dynatrace tenant.
</p>
<p>
    To avoid this problem, the plugin supports defining the <code>dql-variables.json</code> JSON file containing
    mappings <code>variable name</code>: <code>variable value</code>. Multiple files are supported, and they are loaded
    using the hierarchical order ("my directory first, then check the parent directory"). This approach allows the user
    to share common variables between different scripts.
</p>
<p>
    The <code>dql-variables.json</code> file contains <strong>placeholder values</strong> - the plugin replaces variable
    expressions used in the query with the data loaded from the file.
<p>
    For example, consider the following DQL query and <code>dql-variables.json</code> file:
</p>
<pre><code>
data $myData
| fieldsAdd {
    contains_array = in($myArray, "value1", "value2"),
    contains_string = contains(message, $myMessage),
    count_equals = count == $myCount
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
{
    "myData": {"message" : "test message", "count": 5, "bool": true},
    "myArray": ["value1", "value3"],
    "myMessage": "test",
    "myCount": 2
}
</code></pre>
<p>Will result with the following DQL query:</p>
<pre><code>
data record(message = "test message", count = 5.0, bool = true)
| fieldsAdd {
    contains_array = in(array("value1", "value3"), "value1", "value2"),
    contains_string = contains(message, "test"),
    count_equals = count == 2
}
</code></pre>
