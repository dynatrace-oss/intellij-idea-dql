Ensures the configuration is applied to an expression that allows it.

<p>
    Not all DPL expressions have a configuration defined. This inspection makes sure that only expression with at least
    one parameter can be provided.
</p>

<pre><code>
'// This is a valid configuration provided for the expression (FLOAT command supports parameters)'
FLOAT(min=1, max=3)?:f
'// This is an invalid configuration provided for the expression (EOL command does not support parameters)'
EOL(someParameter=true)
</code></pre>

After applying the quick fix, the configuration will be dropped.
