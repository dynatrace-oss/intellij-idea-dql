Ensures member fields are specified in a correct context.

<p>
    This inspection reports an error if it encounters member field names specified outside the members list matchers.
</p>

<pre><code>
'// Double field names can be only specified when defining the member field lists, for example in JSON command'
EOL:"some member name":fieldName
</code></pre>

After applying the quick fix, the member field name will be dropped.
