Validates the joining <code>on</code> condition.

<p>
    The <code>on</code> parameter in the joining conditions needs to have a proper syntax in order to validate
    successfully. You can provide multiple conditions, and they all need to be valid.
</p>

<p>
    A valid joining condition uses the equality expression between two special fields called <code>left</code>
    (the original query context) and <code>right</code> (the joined query context). You can also specify just the
    field name if both queries include it.
</p>

<pre><code>
data json: "..."
| join [...] on: id // if the "id" is in both queries, the condition is OK
| join [...] on: left[dt.entity.host] == right[id] // if the fields are different, you need to use the "left" and "right" fields
// you can also provide multiple conditions using a valid syntax for each of them
| join [...] on: {
    left[service.id] == right[id],
    left[cloudType] == right[cloud],
    dt.entity.host
}
</code></pre>
