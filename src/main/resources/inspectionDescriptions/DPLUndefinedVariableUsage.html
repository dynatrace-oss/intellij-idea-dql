Ensures all used variables are defined.

<p>
    This inspection will report an error if it discovers a variable usage that wasn't defined in the pattern.
</p>

<pre><code>
'// We are defining the $variable'
$variable = INT:i;
'// This is an error: we are using $variable2, which was not defined'
LONG:l $variable2
</code></pre>

After applying the quick fix, the unused variable will be dropped or a definition for the variable will be added.
