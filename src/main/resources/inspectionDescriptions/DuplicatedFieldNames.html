Verifies if a field is not duplicated on the field list.
<p>
    In some contexts, you can only specify the same field once; otherwise it would overwrite the previous value.
</p>
<pre><code>
fetch logs
  | fields {
    field1 = somevalue,
    field1 = othervalue // will cause an error, because the "field1" was already defined on the list
  }
</code></pre>
<p>
    After applying the quick-fix, the selected field will be dropped, resolving the duplication.
    You can also, alternatively, rename the field.
