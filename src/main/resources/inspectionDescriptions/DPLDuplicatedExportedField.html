Verifies if the export name is used only once.

<p>
    This inspection shows an issue if the export name was already used in the DPL definition.
</p>

<pre><code>
'// The export name "i" was used twice, so the second one always overwrites the first one'
INT:i LONG:i
</code></pre>

After applying the quick fix, the user can decide whether he should rename the field name or drop the export name.
