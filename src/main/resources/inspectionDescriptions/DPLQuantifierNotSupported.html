Ensures quantifiers are provided for an expression that supports them.

<p>
    Not all DPL expressions support quantifiers.
    This inspection will report an error if quantifiers were provided for an expression that does not allow them.
</p>

<pre><code>
'// The DATA command supports quantifiers'
DATA{1, 10}:data
'// This is an error: the ENUM command does not support quantifiers'
ENUM{''=-3, 'success'=0}{1, 2}:result
</code></pre>

After applying the quick fix, the quantifiers configuration will be dropped.
