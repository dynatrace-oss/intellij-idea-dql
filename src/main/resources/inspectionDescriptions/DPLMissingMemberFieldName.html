Ensures member fields are specified in the members list matcher.

<p>
    This inspection reports an error if it encounters an expression inside members list matchers without specifying
    its name.
</p>

<pre><code>
// Long will report an error because it is missing the field name definition
JSON {
    int:"number field",
    ld:string_field,
    long
}
</code></pre>

After applying the quick fix, the member field name template will be created for the user to fulfil.
