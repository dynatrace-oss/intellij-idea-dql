Checks usage of nested negative values.

<p>
    Nested negative values are much harder to understand, whether the value is positive or negative.
    The inspection reports a notice that the value could be simplified by removing unnecessary <code>-</code> signs.
    Although <strong>the expression is perfectly valid on DQL</strong>, it still useful for code style quality
    remove unnecessary negative values.
</p>
<pre><code>
data record()
  | fields {
      field = ------55,  // is the same as "field = 55"
      field2 = -------55 // is the same as "field2 = -55"
  }
</code></pre>
<p>After applying the quick-fix, the negative value will be simplified.</p>
