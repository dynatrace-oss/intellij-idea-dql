Checks if both sides of an arithmetical operation are valid.
<p>
    This inspection focuses on the validity of types returned by expressions used in the operation.
    The information shown to the user will compare all possible types for the left, and the right side, with values
    returned by the expression.
    To be a deemed valid expression, both sides must be supported data types.
    See all supported operation types
    <a href="https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/references/dynatrace-query-language/operators">
        in the official Dynatrace documentation.

<pre><code>
data json: "..."
| fields field = 22 * "string", // string is not a valid arithmetical target when multiplying numbers
    field2 = now() / 5 // timestamp cannot be used as a left side for the divide operation
