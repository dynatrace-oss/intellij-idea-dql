Verifies the usage of supported DQL commands.

<p>
    This inspection reports an error if it detects a keyword that belongs to an unknown command.
    No further validations will be performed on such command.
</p>

<pre><code>
unknownCommand true, from: now() // will report an error, because "unknownCommand" is not a valid command keyword
</code></pre>

<p>
    After applying the quick fix, the unknown DQL statement will be dropped.
