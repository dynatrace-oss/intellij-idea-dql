Ensures matchers are provided for a command that requires them.

<p>
    This inspection will report an error if it detects a command that did not define matchers when the definition
    requires them.

<pre><code>
'// ENUM requires matchers to be specified (within {})'
ENUM
</code></pre>

After applying the quick fix, the matchers will be added.
