Verifies the usage of the "partial.dql" file names.

<p>
    Including "partial." within the file name to define a partial DQL file was replaced with the ".dqlpart" extension.
    This would help to define injected code blocks containing parts of the DQL language (for example, creating the DQL
    query dynamically).
    This inspection will report an issue if the file name contains "partial." and suggest renaming the file to use
    the ".dqlpart" extension instead.

    After applying the quick fix, the file name will be updated automatically.
