Reports an error when an invalid alias definition is found.

<p>
    DQL language allows to define a name for an expression in two major ways: via the assign expression
    (name = value), and by specifying the alias for the field (value, alias: name).

    This inspection validates if there was no conflict between both (you cannot specify two names for the field at the
    same time) and if the alias parameter was specified in a correct place.
</p>

<pre><code>
data json: "..."
| fields {
    f1 = 5, alias: "field1", // you should not specify an alias if the assign expression was already provided
    alias: "field2" // the alias is not related to any expression providing value
},
    alias: "something" // the "data" command does not have a parameter named alias
</code></pre>

<p>After applying the quick fix, an invalid alias will be dropped.</p>
