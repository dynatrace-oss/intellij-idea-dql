Verifies if the "metrics" command could be used.

<p>
    The metric.series data object was marked as deprecated and was replaced with a dedicated command named metrics. All
    usages should migrate to a new solution.
</p>
<p>
    This inspection reports an issue if it detects usage of fetch metric.series.
</p>

<pre><code>
fetch metric.series, from: -4h, to: -1h, bucket: "test", samplingRatio: 5, scanLimitGBytes: 1
</code></pre>

<p>
    After applying the quick-fix, the command will be automatically updated to "metrics".
</p>
<pre><code>
metrics from: -4h, to: -1h, bucket: "test"
</code></pre>
