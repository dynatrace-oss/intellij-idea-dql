Reports an error if a DQL command is used in a wrong place.

<p>
    DQL has two different groups of commands: one that can start the DQL query,
    and the second one that manages the set of data, the first one returned.
    They cannot be used in a wrong context.
</p>
<pre><code>
data json: "..." // is allowed query start command
| filter field == true // is allowed query manipulation command
| append [
   summarize field // this will report an error, because the append command block requires a query start command
]
</code></pre>

<p>
    In some cases, DQL files are split into smaller ones, for example, when dynamically building a big DQL file using
    <a href="https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/deliver/configuration-as-code/monaco/configuration/yaml-configuration">Monaco</a>.

    This inspection would then render such smaller pieces of the query as errors. You can disable this inspection by
    renaming your file to "file_name<strong>.partial</strong>.dql".
