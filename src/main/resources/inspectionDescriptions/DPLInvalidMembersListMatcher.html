Verifies the correct structure for members list matchers.

<p>
    This inspection reports an error if it detects a command that expects a comma-separated list of members,
    but the user defined another type of the matcher.
</p>

<pre><code>
// This will report an error, because "JSON" expects to have matchers of comma-separated members list
JSON{
 INT IPADDR
}
</code></pre>
