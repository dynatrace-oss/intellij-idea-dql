Validates if the filtering condition is not negated.

<p>
    DQL supports different ways of filtering data - "filter" and "filterOut" commands exist to make the condition
    easier to understand.
    This inspection will report an issue if it finds a filtering command with a negated condition.
</p>
<pre><code>
data record()
| filter not true
| filterOut not false
</code></pre>

After applying the quick fix, the filtering command will be flipped.

<pre><code>
data record()
| filterOut true
| filter false
</code></pre>
