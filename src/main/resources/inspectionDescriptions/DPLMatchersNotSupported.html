Ensures matchers are provided for a command that supports them.

<p>
    Not all DPL command support matchers.
    This inspection will mark all matchers provided for a command that does not support them as an error.
</p>

<pre><code>
'// The JSON_VALUE command supports specifying a type in the command matchers'
JSON_VALUE{IPADDR}:ip
'// This is an error: the EOL command does not support any matchers'
EOL{'first'=0}
</code></pre>

After applying the quick fix, the matchers configuration will be dropped.
