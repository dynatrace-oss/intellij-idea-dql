### Added

- Initial version of the plugin
- Adding support for Dynatrace Query Language files (`.dql`):
  - Customizable syntax highlighting
  - Local code inspections with quick fixes if possible
  - Customizable code style support â€” enforcing indents, line breaking and spaces around elements
  - Advanced code completion
  - Hover documentation for commands, parameters, and functions
- Added an option to connect to a Dynatrace tenant, which allows to:
  - perform live validations on all DQL files (meaning detecting the same issues as in Dynatrace Notebooks)
  - execute DQL queries and show results as a table directly in IntelliJ IDEA
  - autocomplete DQL fields
- Partial files support `NAME.partial.dql`:
  - disables live validations and inspections related to query completeness (like missing the data source command or
    starting with the `|` symbol)
  - very helpful for projects containing a lot of dynamically joined DQL queries
- Variables support for DQL queries:
  - special support for DQL queries stored for Dynatrace Dashboards which allows the user to define global variables
    that are automatically replaced within queries
  - the plugin adds support for `dql-variables.json` file that contains the static placeholder value that will replace
    the variable
  - the file is loaded in a hierarchical order: from the same directory, then to the parent one, etc.
  - the file supports specifying `record` (JSON object), `array` (JSON array), `string`, `boolean`, `number`, and
    `null` types.
